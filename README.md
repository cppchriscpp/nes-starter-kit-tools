# nes-starter-kit tools

This is a small repository for the tools used by nes-starter-kit. 

They are built in nodejs, and compiled into binaries for both windows and linux
using pkg. Each tool is in a separate folder, and they are all built independently.

Check the Releases tab for the latest downloads. You can extract these into the tools
folder of your project and use them. (Though, if you use create-nes-game, this should
be automated!)
